# Healthcare Resource and Healthcare Accessibility Scores in Cook County

Heakthcare access is defined as the ability to get healthcare services, or a measure of how easily a client can reach a provider's location.  

Healthcare accessibility is made up of three essential factors:
* Healthcare capacity: The supply of healthcare services, which can be represented by the number of facilities, physicians, or sickbeds
* Population demand: The demand for healthcare services
* Geographic impedance: How easily the client can physically reach the provider's location

For our project, we visualize the healthcare accessibility in different ways and assign the healthcare accessibility score to each zipcodes and explore the key attributes that affect the healthcare accessibility.

Our project is based on [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/data-research)'s CAHPS Standard Surveys for healthcare facilities, census data赵老师概括一下，and physcians' open information scraped on [healthgrades](https://www.healthgrades.com/), which has amassed information on over three million U.S. health care providers.

We hope our project will give some insights on the healthcare accessibility condition in Cook County and possible features that may be improved for better healthcare accessibility in the region.
