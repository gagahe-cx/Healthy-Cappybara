## Library Usage Rationale

### Why `lxml` and `BeautifulSoup`?

In this project, we utilize both `lxml` and `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing and processing. This combination is chosen to leverage the strengths of each library in handling different types of HTML structures we encounter across various web pages.

### Advantages of `lxml`:
- **Performance**: `lxml` is implemented in C, making it extremely fast for parsing well-formed HTML documents.
- **Efficiency**: Ideal for processing large volumes of data due to its speed and robust parsing capabilities.
- **XPath and XSLT Support**: Provides extensive support for XPath and XSLT operations, making complex data extraction tasks more manageable.

### Why the Addition of `BeautifulSoup`?
- **Tolerance for Malformed HTML**: Certain web pages with non-standard HTML structures proved challenging for `lxml`. `BeautifulSoup`, with its `html.parser`, excels in handling such irregular HTML, making it a valuable tool for parsing:
  - Doctor categories directory at [Healthgrades Specialty Directory](https://www.healthgrades.com/specialty-directory).
  - Illinois cardiology directory at [Healthgrades Cardiology Directory in Illinois](https://www.healthgrades.com/cardiology-directory/il-illinois).

### Integration with Selenium:
For web pages requiring dynamic interaction (e.g., JavaScript-rendered content), we integrate Selenium to programmatically interact with and extract data from these pages.

### Conclusion:
Our choice to use both `lxml` and `BeautifulSoup` (alongside Selenium for specific cases) is strategic, aiming to combine `lxml`'s speed and efficiency with `BeautifulSoup`'s flexibility in handling a broad spectrum of HTML structures. This ensures comprehensive and efficient data collection across diverse web resources.
